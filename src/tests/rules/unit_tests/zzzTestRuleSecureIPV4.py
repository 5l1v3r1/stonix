This is a Unit Test for Rule ConfigureAppleSoftwareUpdate

@author: ekkehard j. koch
@change: 03/04/2013 Original Implementation
@change: 2016/02/10 roy Added sys.path.append for being able to unit test this
                        file as well as with the test harness.
@change: 2016/06/01 eball Added statechglogger to FileHelper parameters
@change: 2016/07/08 ekkehard complete renaming to SecureIPV4
