This is a Unit Test for Rule SystemAccounting

@author: Breen Malmberg
@change: 2015/09/25 eball Updated to enable CI so that rule runs during test
@change: 2015/09/25 eball Added Debian/Ubuntu setup
@change: 2015/10/09 eball Updated Deb setup to improve automated testing compat
@change: 2015/10/26 eball Comment fix, added informative text for test failure
