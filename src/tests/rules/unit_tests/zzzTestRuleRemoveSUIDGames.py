'''
This is a Unit Test for Rule RemoveSUIDGames

@author: Eric Ball
@change: 2015/08/20 eball Original Implementation
@change: 2015/09/22 eball Added error info if gnuchess install fails
@change: 2015/09/25 eball Updated for OSs that do not have gnuchess pkg
@change: 2016/02/10 roy Added sys.path.append for being able to unit test this
                        file as well as with the test harness.
