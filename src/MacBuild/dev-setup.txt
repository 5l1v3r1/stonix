Instructions for setting up the Development Environment for this project:

Install Eclipse

Install SetupTools
        • Download Setup Tools at: http://pypi.python.org/pypi/setuptools
        • Run it as if it were a shell script, e.g. sudo sh setuptools-0.6c11-py2.7.egg. Setuptools will install itself using the matching version of Python (e.g. python2.7), and will place the easy_install executable in the default location for installing Python scripts (as determined by the standard distutils configuration files, or by the Python installation).

Install PyLint
        • udo easy_install-2.7 pylint

Install PyDev
        • Download the source zip
        • unzip
        • copy features/* to eclipse/features
        • copy plugins/* to eclipse/plugins
        • restart eclipse

Install xCode From AppStore
        • Download and install Xcode
        • Download and install the Command Line Tools from within Xcode
        • Preferences -> Downloads -> Components. I believe these are also available from the Apple Developer Connection site.

Install Apple Auxilary Tool
        • Download the Xcode Auxiliary Tools from the Apple Developer Connection site.
        • Mount the DMG, and
        • copy PackageMaker.app into /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Applications
        • Remove the old packagemaker symlink: sudo rm /usr/local/bin/packagemaker
Note: If the image has been used, the above two steps are already done.
