###
# This process should only be used to build stonix4mac AFTER you have set up
# the build tools (buildingBuildToolsCommands-revX.txt), set up the signing
# certificates (buildingSigningCertificate.txt), and have set the ram memory
# size of your build vm to 16G.

1. Update the stonix version in 'src/stonix_resources/localize.py' and 'src/MacBuild/build.conf'. Make sure your current directory is "src/MacBuild".

2.

To build STONIX with signing, run the following command:
time sudo python3 ./build.py -d -s "Developer ID" -k /Users/[localadmin]/Library/Keychains/login.keychain-db 2>&1 | tee build-output_`/bin/date "+%Y-%m-%d_%H-%M-%S"`.log

To build STONIX without signing, run the following command:
time sudo python3 ./build.py -d 2>&1 | tee build-output_`/bin/date "+%Y-%m-%d_%H-%M-%S"`.log

3. If you are building STONIX with signing, you will be prompted to enter a keychain password. This will likely be your local user password.

# If the build was successful, the package should
