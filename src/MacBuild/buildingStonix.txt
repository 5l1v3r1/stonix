###
# This process should only be used to build stonix4mac AFTER you have set up
# the build tools (refer to buildingBuildToolsCommands.txt).
#
# If you are on the STONIX development team and would like to build stonix4mac
# with certificate signing, please refer to buildingStonixWithSigningCertificate.txt

1. Update the stonix version in 'src/stonix_resources/localize.py' and 'src/MacBuild/build.conf'. Make sure your current directory is "src/MacBuild".

2. To build stonix4mac without signing, run the following command:
time sudo python3 ./build.py -d 2>&1 | tee build-output_`/bin/date "+%Y-%m-%d_%H-%M-%S"`.log

#####
#
# If the build was successful, the package should
# be in the src/MacBuild/dmgs directory.
