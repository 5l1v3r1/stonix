###
# This process should only be used to build stonix4mac AFTER you have set up
# the build tools (buildingBuildToolsCommands-revX.txt), set up the signing
# certificates (buildingSigningCertificate.txt), and have set the ram memory
# size of your build vm to 16G.

1. Update the stonix version in 'src/stonix_resources/localize.py' and 'src/MacBuild/build.conf'.

2. Run the following command:
sudo -E ./build.py -d -s "Developer ID" --keychain /Users/[localadmin]/Library/Keychains/login.keychain-db

3. You will be prompted to enter a keychain password. This will likely be your local user password.

#####
# If the build was successful, the package should be in the dmgs directory.
