    The ServiceHelper class serves as an abstraction layer between rules that
    need to manipulate services and the actual implementation of changing
    service status on various operating systems.

    @Note: Interface methods abstracted to allow for different parameter
           lists for different helpers.  This moves the requirement for 
           input validation the the concrete helpers.
