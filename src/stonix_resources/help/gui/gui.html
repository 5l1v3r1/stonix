<img src="gui/stonix-user-mode-mac.png" alt="Stonix in User mode">

This mode is running Stonix in User mode.  Some configurations need to be run
in the user's home directory, and when mounting remote directories, the root
user may be prevented from setting any values in that users home directory, so
some rules need to be run in "User" mode to ensure user configurations are set
securely.
