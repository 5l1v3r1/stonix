<h2>Logs</h2>

STONIX logs its actions to the system syslog facility.  When run in User mode,
the STONIX log is placed in ~/.stonix. When run in root/Admin mode, the
log is placed in /var/log.
<p>
More detailed logs can be run at the command line by using the "-dv" flags.
<p>
STONIX is also set up to send XML reports to a server.  The intent is for that 
server to insert these logs into a database for record-keeping purposes.
<p>
The STONIX logging facility is also set up to send syslog level ERROR messages
to both the server and to an email address, so problems can be dealt with swiftly.
