<h2>Logs</h2>

Stonix logs its actions to the system syslog facility.  When run in User mode,
the stonix log is placed in ~/.stonix.
<p>
More detailed logs can be run at the command line by using the "-dv" flags.

Stonix is also set up to send xml reports to a server.  The intent is for that 
server to insert these logs into a database for record keeping purposes.
<p>
The Stonix logging facility is also set up to send syslog level ERROR messages
to both the server and to an email address, so problems can be dealt with swiftly.
