<h2>Scheduling</h2>

Stonix uses the native OS facility for scheduling regular Stonix runs in the
background.  On Linux, it uses Cron, and on MacOS it uses launchd jobs.
<p>
Two jobs are scheduled to run in elevated (root) mode when the machine boots,
and on a regularly scheduled basis.  One run is in "report" mode, and one run
is in "fix" mode. 
<p>
The user based job is also scheduled to run on a regular basis in fix mode. 
*nix systems can have user home directories mounted from network shares, 
which can be mounted so root can not access them.  This is the reason for the
stonix run scheduled to be run as a user on the system.
<p>
The Stonix rule ScheduleStonix sets up the regularly scheduled
Stonix runs.
