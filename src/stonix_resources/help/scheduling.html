<h1>Scheduling</h1>
<p>
STONIX uses the native OS facility for scheduling regular STONIX runs in the
background. On Linux it uses cron, and on OS X it uses launchd jobs.
<p>
Two jobs are scheduled to run in an elevated (root) context on a regularly
scheduled basis. One job is run in Report Mode, and one run is run in Fix Mode.
<p>
A job that runs in user context is also scheduled to run on a regular basis
(Fix Mode only). *NIX systems can have user home directories mounted from network shares, 
which can be mounted in such a way that root cannot access them. This necessitates
the user context job.
<p>
The STONIX rule ScheduleStonix sets up the regularly scheduled STONIX runs.
