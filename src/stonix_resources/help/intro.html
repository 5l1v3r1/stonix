<p>
  STONIX is an operating system configuration hardening tool for Unix and Unix-like
  (e.g. Linux) operating systems. This tool implements a hybrid of
  guidance from <a href="http://www.nsa.gov">NSA</a>,
  <a href="http://iase.disa.mil/stigs/Pages/index.aspx">DISA STIGs</a>,
  <a href="http://usgcb.nist.gov/">USGCB</a> and the
  <a href="https://www.cisecurity.org/">CIS</a>. To as great of a degree as
  possible, each guidance element for each platform is evaluated on the other
  platforms for applicability and applied if possible.
<p>
  The STONIX program is a modular codebase implemented in Python (currently
  using the 2.x dialect, a port to Python 3.0 is in future planning). Python
  was selected due to it being part of the default install on all target
  platforms. The program is primarily a command-line utility but there is a
  robust GUI built in. The GUI is implemented in PyQt. Many platform packages
  will not express a dependecy on PyQt due to the GUI's optional nature.
<p>
  At the present time (revision 0.9.5) the following platforms are used for
  development and test: Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 and 7, Fedora Linux
  22, OpenSuSE 13.2, Debian 7 and 8 (stable), Ubuntu 14.04 LTS, CentOS 7,
  Apple's OS X Mavericks 10.9, OS X Yosemite 10.10, and OS X El Capitan 10.11.
  Close derivatives of these operating systems should be well supported, 
  more distant cousins less so.

<a name="versionNumber"><center><h3>Version numbering</h3></center>
<p>
  STONIX uses a Major.Minor.Release versioning scheme.
<p>  
  At present STONIX is in an Alpha, not feature complete stage. Every attempt 
  is made to ensure that the code is production ready, but the features are not
  yet complete and there will be functionality changes in future revisions.

<a name="reportingBugs"><center><h3>Reporting bugs</h3></center>
<p>
  When reporting issues in STONIX, please fully document the specific 
  functionality that is causing a problem. We will likely need sample 
  configuration files that cause the section of STONIX to have issues. A copy
  of the debug output is also very valuable.

  Report your issue via the <a href="https://github.com/CSD-Public/stonix/issues">STONIX GitHub issue tracker</a>.
