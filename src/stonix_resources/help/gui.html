<h1>Graphical User Interface</h1>
When run from the command line without any options or opened via stonix4mac.app, STONIX will bring up its
graphical user interface (GUI).
<br><br>
<h3 id="usermode">User Mode</h3>
<p>
User mode is run when STONIX is opened by an unprivileged (i.e. non-root/admin) user.
Due to the inability to change most system settings, there are far fewer rules that
will run in User Mode. However, these rules are still important, and certain settings
need to be changed in user context to take effect.
<p>
<h3 id="adminmode">Admin Mode</h3>
<p>
Admin mod is when STONIX is opened by a user with administrative or root privileges.
The majority of rules can be run from this mode.
<p>

<h4>STONIX GUI running in User Mode</h4>
<p>
<ol>
<li>Toolbar: One can operate the full list of rules from these buttons.</li>
	<ul>
	<li>Fix All will run the Fix for all rules that have at least one
	<a href="acronyms.html#CI">CI</a> enabled. If the rule is not enabled,
	only the Report will be run.</li>
	<li>Report All will run the Report for all rules.</li>
	<li>Stop Run will stop a Fix All/Report All run when the current rule
	is completed. Note that this cannot stop a rule in the middle of its run
	(see item 10 below).</li>
	</ul>
<li>List of rules to be run in the current user/root context.</li>
<li>Name of the highlighted rule.</li>
<li>Description of the highlighted rule.</li>
<li>The results of a STONIX run for the currently highlighted rule.</li>
<li>Run the currently highlighted rule in report mode.</li>
<li>Run the currently highlighted rule in fix mode.</li>
<li>Undo the changes done by the Fix. Be sure to read the Rule Description; not all
rules can be reverted.</li>
</ol>
<p>
In the screenshot above, all the rules in the rule list (2) have a grey background, with a question
mark to the left of the rule.  This means the rule hasn't been run yet in this
STONIX session.

<p>
The rule list will have the background of each rule change color once the fix/report
run is complete.
<ul>
<li>Green: System correctly configured for this rule.</li>
<li>Yellow: Optional rule - Not configured correctly for this rule.</li>
<li>Red: System <b><i>NOT</i></b> configured correctly for this rule.</li>
<li>Grey: Rule not yet run this STONIX session.</li>
</ul>

The following is an image of STONIX running in Admin context in Report mode, 
where some of the rules have not yet completed their run.

<h3 id="stonix4mac">stonix4mac Pop-up Menu</h3>
<p>
The Mac OS X version of STONIX has a wrapper that allows a regular user to run STONIX as 
an administrator.
The stonix4mac app brings up the following dialog to give the user a choice as to what
mode to run STONIX in:

<p>
If Admin Mode is chosen, then the following dialog will come up:
<img src="images/administrator-credentials-mac.jpg">
<p>
Entering the credentials of an admin user (which could be the same or different from
the currently logged-in user) will open STONIX in Admin Mode.
<p>

<h3 id="CI">Configuration Items</h3>
<p>
If available, configuration items (CIs) allow modification of how a STONIX rule runs.
<p>
The following is a rule that shows multiple configuration items, with different
data types.
<p>
<img src="images/CIs_numbered.jpg" alt="Configuration Items">
<p>
<ol>
<li>Configuration Item Name: SetDefaultUserUmask.</li>
<li>Description for this CI.</li>
<li>Boolean variable that can be changed.</li>
<li>User comment: Any notes the user wants to make about the rule, or changes
they made to the CI.</li>
<li>The second CI, DefaultUserUmask, takes an integer variable.</li>
<li>Save all changes to CIs to the stonix.conf file.</li>
<li>Undo any unsaved changes to CIs.</li>
</ol>
