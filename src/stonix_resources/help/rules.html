<h2>Rules</h2>

<h3>Introduction to Rules</h3>
A stonix rule is a logical collection of configuration items.  A configuration 
item is a unit that maps to a configuration in a security standard.  For 
example, the BlockSystemAccounts rule maps to  
<a href="acronyms.html#CIS">CIS</a> and <a href="acronyms.html#NSA">NSA</a> 
configuration guidance, while PreventXListen maps to only one piece of 
configuration guidance.
<p>
Some rules have multiple configuration items that may or may not be configurable.
For instance, DisableCloudServices has two configuration items, which both are 
configurable.
