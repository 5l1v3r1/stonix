- Added filter mechanism and variables to support fine tuned actions and rule filtering based on FISMA risk categorization
- Corrected issue with duplicate rule id numbers affecting ConfigureProcessAccounting and EncryptSwap
- Corrected multiple issues with MacOS STIG rules
- Updated MinimizeServices to correct issues on Debian systems
- Corrected permissions problem with SecureATCRON
- Fixed issues with the way that some rules responded to default values in localize.py
- Fixed traceback in DisableInactiveAccounts that affected MacOS
- Fixed multiple issues in ConfigureLogging

* Wed Feb 15 2017 David Kennel <dkennel@lanl.gov> - 0.9.5-1
- Updated release of 0.9.5 to resolve issues
- Fixed issue in secure cups which broke printing
- Default behavior for ConfigureLinuxFirewall is now for the rule to be disabled by default

* Fri Feb 3 2017 David Kennel <dkennel@lanl.gov> - 0.9.5
- Corrected bug that caused STONIX to not recognize when firewalld was running.
- New rule added: ConfigureFirefox. The configure Firefox rule will disable all automatic update and "phone home" behavior and configure the browser for SSO authentication.
- New rule added: ConfigureFirewall. This rule will enable the system firewall on supported platforms and configure it with reasonable rules. In most cases this means block all inbound except SSH and permit all outbound.
- New rule ForceIdleLogout. This optional rule will force idle Gnome and KDE sessions to log off
- Corrected an issue where the State Change Logger did not record file changes correctly when the "old" file did not exist.
- BootSecurity(18): Changed method of reporting to audit the service rather than just checking a list of services (which included disabled and removed services), making report results more accurate.
- CheckRootPath(44): Now includes a fix, to ensure that root's PATH matches the vendor default.
- ConfigureLANLLDAP(254): Running the rule multiple times on NSLCD systems will no longer result in repeated lines in nsswitch.conf
- ConfigureScreenLocking(74): Originally based on gconftool-2, this was updated to work with the newer gsettings command. Fixed potential bugs in GNOME 3 systems, where the picture-uri variable was not being set. Fixed idle-delay being off (set to 0) appearing as compliant. Rule now checks for "No such key" as gconftool-2/gsettings output, which indicates a compliant state (this was previously seen as a failure).
- FilePermissions(25): Cleaned up and clarified feedback.
- MinimizeServices(12): Added psacct, iptables, ip6tables, ssh, ssh.service, lvm2-activation-early.service, lvm2-activation.service to approved services.
- PasswordExpiration(42): Accounts will be disabled 35 days after the password expires.
- RemoveSUIDGames(244): An issue was found where removing certain games resulted in other games being installed. Made removal function recursive, with a depth limit of 6 to avoid infinite loops.
- SecureHomeDir(45): Added try/except to avoid errors if /home/{user} does not exist.
- SecureMDNS(135): Updated to disable zeroconf networking, per CCE-RHEL7-CCE-TBD 2.5.2.
- SecureNFS(39): Improved help text.
- Rule NetworkTuning(15) renamed SecureIPV4(15)
- ConfigureLogging - now properly logs for authentication events on .deb systems
- PasswordExpiration - PASS_MIN_LEN directive no longer applicable for login.defs file on .deb and opensuse systems.
- RemoveSoftware – New rule

- Fixed a chmod issue, on the banner text file, in InstallBanners
- Fixed a missing configuration option disable-user-list in InstallBanners, for Debian 7
- InstallBanners banner text updated to meet compliance standards on RHEL 7

- Fixed a pathing error in InstallBanners, for OpenSuSE 13.2
- SystemAccounting will now show as passing, during compliance run, if not enabled. Added doc strings to each method. Rule will now check to see if its CI is enabled or not, in report. Changed CI instructions to be more clear to the end user. Added several in-line comments. Added messaging to indicate to the end user, whether the rule will run its fix or not, based on whether the CI is enabled or not
- SystemAccounting's Unit test will now auto enable its CI when run, in order to properly test the rule's full functionality.
- Fixed an issue with a regular expression in SecureNFS, looking for class A addresses
- SecureNFS New Feature – Will now ensure there are no overly broad NFS exports (exports to an entire class B or larger subnet; exports to an entire DNS domain; etc.)
- Fixed an issue in SecureNFS which was allowing it to start the nfsd service even if it was not already started
- Updated SecureNFS rule with support for host access lists for each export

- New rule: ConfigureProcessAccounting(97): Enables the process accounting service, psacct.
- New rule: DisablePrelinking(89)
- New rule: InstallRootCert(10): Adds and activates the LANL root certificate
- logdispatcher: Now handles errors caused by a non-existent e-mail address. This relieves hanging on non-network-connected machines.
- stonix4mac: There will no longer be a symlink stonix.conf in the /Applications/stonix4mac/... path. The installer will only create, and only look for, /etc/stonix.conf
- SHupdaterc: Added '$' to end of regex in auditservice() method, so that searches are more accurate.
- stonix4mac: Added ownership changes to postinstall script to ensure that all files are owned by root
- GUI: Configuration items (CIs) no longer show up when STONIX is run in User context
- PAM stack variables are now part of localize.py, so that they can be easily localized for non-LANL users
- Changed Fedora to dnf packagehelper; updated rules DisableInteractiveStartup, InstallVLock, SecureDHCPServer, SecureNFS, SecurePOPIMAP for this change.
- There is currently a bug with Debian8/python which prevents
- ConfigureMACPolicy from running correctly on that OS
- Fixed an issue which was causing apparmor to not load on restart (on systems which use apparmor) after running fix in ConfigureMACPolicy (note: there is still a bug with Debian python which prevents this rule from ever being compliant after fix. This is not a stonix bug/issue. It will remain this way untilt he Debian folks fix this issue.)
- Fixed a typo in a method call, in ConfigureMACPolicy which was preventing the rule from loading on rhel 6 systems
- There is an issue in Debian's version of gdm3 which prevents certain required security configuration options from being enabled at the same time. As a result, STONIX will now force the use of lightdm as the display manager for Debian systems found running gdm3 as their display manager
- MuteMic now mutes mics on systemd and init systems at boot time
- Fixed a referenced before a assignment variable problem in EnablePAEandNX (this was causing a traceback under certain circumstances)

- Issues with both the underlying framework and the rule itself were fixed to resolve multiple issues with SecureCUPS rule
- Fixed a configuration file path for Fedora 24, in ForceIdleLogout
- Fixed an issue with SetNTP where it would not install ntp or chrony if neither existed on the system, and would simply report compliant. It now installs the correct package, depending on the system, and configures it
- Fixed an issue with EnableKernelAuditing which was preventing audit rules from being loaded
- Fixed a configuration issue, in EnableKernelAuditing, with ausyscall stime only having a 32-bit syscall (was issuing an arch=b64 call which was causing a traceback)
- EnableKernelAuditing New Feature – EnableKernelAuditing will now audit a configuration slightly exceeding the LSPP
- Fixed a reporting issue with EnableKernelAuditing which was causing it to wrongly report that the fix had failed
- Fixed multiple pathing issues for MinimizeAcceptedDHCPOptions, for rhel, fedora, centos, opensuse

- Fixed a race condition between VerifySysFilePerms and SymlinkDangerFiles rules, by leaving /private/etc/hosts.equiv as a file and just ensuring it remains empty
- Fixed an issue with SymlinkDangerFiles which was causing VerifySysFilePerms to report as NCAF on some Mac OS X systems (different than the above race condition)
- Updated DisableAFPFileSharing rule with commands to make it compatible with 10.11 and 10.12. Updated the commands in the Unit test for this rule as well
- ssh and sshd configurations will now be written to the correct “/etc/ssh/” directory, instead of “/etc/”
- Fixed an init traceback of MinimizeAcceptedDHCPOptions on Mac OS X systems
- ConfigureNetworks will now properly disable wi-fi devices on the system when in an area not appropriate for wi-fi – even if the device is not listed in the service list (this is a workaround for an el capitan OS bug)
- Fixed a missing function call in one of the framework classes, for ConfigureNetworks which was causing false negative reporting after the rule's fix had been run
- Fixed many doc strings, added debug logging for, and fixed numerous log issues for – ConfigureNetworks rule and the associated networksetup helper class
