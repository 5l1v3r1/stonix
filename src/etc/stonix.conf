# documentation for this file with man stonix.conf.
[MAIN]
version = 100
[RemoveBadDotFiles]
# The Remove Bad Dot Files rule will remove .netrc, .shosts, and .rhosts files located in user home directories. The .netrc file is used to automate connections via FTP. When present the .netrc file frequently contains plaintext passwords. The .shosts and .rhosts files are used in support of the R commands and use an extremely weak form of authentication. An option is given for disabling this rule but this rule should only be disabled after a thorough review of the proposed use of .netrc, .shosts or .rhosts files to ensure that a potential security issue is not created by the use of the files.

[NetworkTuning]
# This rule configures the system's network stack settings.For Solaris systems, this rule requires a full system reboot to take effect so the rule after running fix may still show that it is non compliant until system is rebooted.  For solaris systems, if you have a startup script that configures your network stack, as is the only efficient way to do it, firstly this file should appear in /etc/init.d and secondly, in order to pass compliance, it will check for the existence for a file named S70ndd-nettune.  Of course, this may not be the name of your file that controls your network parameter tuning, so please keep in mind, your system may fail compliance due to this issue.

[FilePermissions]
# The File Permissions rule audits and folders on the system to check for world
# writable files, world writable folders, SUID/SGID programs and files without
# known owners. It ensures that the sticky-bit is set on world writable
# directories and will remove world write permissions from files in the root
# users execution PATH environment variable. Note that file permission changes
# cannot be undone.
# When possible files and folders will be checked with the package
# manager records to see if their presence is authorized by belonging to an
# installed package. Administrators should review the lists of world writable,
# SUID and unowned files and folders carefully since these types of files and
# programs may provide opportunities for attackers to abuse the system. Files
# that contain the output of the search are located at /var/local/info and should
# be reviewed to ensure that the files listed are expected to be in that state
# for this system. Please note that this rule may take several minutes to run.
# Because this rule performs a full file system scan you may not
# want it to scan very large directly attached file systems (especially file
# systems on USB media). Any file systems listed in a space separated list after
# the BYPASSFS variable will not be scanned. N.B. This list does not handle
# file system names with spaces.
bypassfs = /run/media /media 
UCbypassfs = 

[SecureHomeDir]
# Ensures that each user's home directory is not group writeable or world readable

[SystemAccounting]
# System accounting is an optional process which gathers baseline system data (CPU utilization, disk I/O, etc.) every 10 minutes, by default. The data may be accessed with the sar command, or by reviewing the nightly report files named /var/log/sa/sar*. Once a normal baseline for the system has been established, with frequent monitoring - unauthorized activity (password crackers and other CPU-intensive jobs, and activity outside of normal usage hours) may be detected due to departures from the normal system performance curve.
# To enable this rule, set the value of SYSTEMACCOUNTING to True
SYSTEMACCOUNTING = True
UCSYSTEMACCOUNTING = 

[ConfigureAIDE]
# Install and configure Advanced Intrusion Detection
#         Environment (AIDE). This rule is optional and will install and
#         configure AIDE when it is run.

[SetNTP]
# Configures Network Time Protocol (NTP) servers.

[ConfigureScreenLocking]
# This rule will configure Screen locking after 15 minutes of continuous inactivity.  This rule will only configure screen locking for gnome and kde.  Other Desktop Managers may be supported in the future. This rule should work the same for all operating systems due to the consistency of kde and gnome. If either or both kde and gnome are not installed this will count as a pass. ***Please be advised: there is no undo method for this rule***

[RootMailAlias]
# Set an alias for root mail on the system so that it is read by an actual human.

[SoftwarePatching]
# The SoftwarePatching rule will check to see if the patched, is using local update sources if available and is using gpg secured updates where applicable. This rule will also ensure that the system has a scheduled (cron) job to install updates automatically on systems where that is feasible.

[BootloaderPerms]
# This rule will verify the permissions on the boot         loader config file to be root:root and 600

[CheckDupIDs]
# The check for duplicate IDs rule is an audit only rule that will examine local account databases for accounts that have duplicate UID values. All accounts must be unique for accountability purposes.

[DisableScreenSavers]
# Disable certain Screen savers that may contain disk contents including CUI text or images

[TCPWrappers]
# TCPWrappers is a library which provides simple
#         access control and standardized logging for supported applications
#         which accept connections over a network. Historically, TCPWrappers was
#         used to support inetd services. Now that inetd is deprecated
#         (see Section 3.2.1), TCPWrappers supports only services which were
#         built to make use of the libwrap library.

[VerifyAccPerms]
# Ensure that the user account databases (passwd, shadow, group, gshadow, etc) have the correct (secure) permissions.

[SetDaemonUmask]
# The settings file /etc/sysconfig/init contains settings which apply to all processes started at boot time. The system umask must be set to at least 022, or daemon processes may create world-writable files. The more restrictive setting 027 protects files, including temporary files and log files, from unauthorized reading by unprivileged users on the system. The SetDaemonUmask class searches for each of the relevant config files and sets the process daemon umask to 022 (0022) to prevent world writability/readability on the system.

[DisableUnusedFs]
# The disable unused file systems rule will remove
# support for uncommon filesystems on this platform. Unused file system
# support increases the system attack profile while providing no benefit
# to the system operators. Options are given for disabling this rule or
# tuning the list of filesystems that should be disabled. Tuning is
# preferable to disabling the rule.
# This list contains file system types that will be
# disabled. If you need to use a file system currently listed remove it and the
# support for that file system type will not be disabled. This list should be
# space separated.
fslist = cramfs freevxfs jffs2 hfs hfsplus squashfs 
UCfslist = 

[NoEmptyPasswords]
# This rule ensures there are no empty password hashes in the /etc/shadow file. If empty passwords exist, a login can occur w/o entering a password and being authenticated.

[CheckRootPath]
# The Secure Root Path class checks all directories in the root $PATH variable 
# for user/world-writable entries, and if any are found then remove them from the 
# root $PATH.

[ConfigureLogging]
# This rule combines several tasks.  Log Rotation to ensure that logs don't completely fill up disk space.  Configures logwatch on the central log server.  After the fix runs, you may want to check the configuration files that were altered to be reformatted to line up correctly with columns such as in newsyslog.conf in freebsd.  This is purely personal preference. For operating systems such as linux, many log file entries may have their own block as well, many of the blocks may contain the same contents. Feel free to combine all of these on one line.  If an entry in the linux fix has incorrect log specs inside the brackets, the log entry is removed where it previously existed and then rewritten with the recommended specs and does not retain any of the user's previous specs.  However, where that log was removed, the specs inside the brackets may remain with no log file to accompany it.  Delete these as they will make your configuration file invalid

[EnableSELinux]
# The EnableSELinux class enables and configures SELinux on support OS platforms.  For debian and ubuntu systems, due to the way that these systems manage selinux, after the fix, your system may still show non compliant but may just need a restart of the system.  debian and debian based systems need a reboot if selinux wasn't previously installed or if selinux was installed but had the wrong configuration file contents.  Be sure to run report again after rebooting system for those particular distributions.  For ubuntu, if selinux needs to be installed, a prompt window may or may not appear during the installation.  Please be aware of this as stonix will pause until interraction with the window i.e. hitting enter (inside the terminal or window, whichever is available) is done

[SecureCUPS]
# With this rule, you can:
#         Disable the CUPS service
#         Disable firewall access to CUPS service
#         Configure CUPS service
#         Disable Printer Browsing
#         Limit Printer Browsing
#         Disable Print Server Capabilities
#         Set the Default Auth Type
#         Setup default set of policy blocks for CUPS

[MuteMic]
# The MuteMic rule will mute or set the microphone input levels to
# zero. This can help prevent a compromised computer from being used as a
# listening device. On most platforms input volume changes require no privileges
# so this setting can be easily undone.

[ScheduleStonix]
# Schedule Stonix to run randomly throughout the week and once in a user context per day

[DisableInteractiveStartup]
# The DisableInteractiveStartup rule disables interactive startup/boot mode.  This may also be known as recovery mode

[SecureSU]
# The su command allows a user to gain the privileges of another user by entering the password for that user's account. It is desirable to restrict the root user so that only known administrators are ever allowed to access the root account. This restricts password-guessing against the root account by unauthorized users or by accounts which have been compromised. By convention, the group wheel contains all users who are allowed to run privileged commands. The PAM module pam_wheel.so is used to restrict root access to this set of users. We will not configure Su for debian distros specifically.

[InstallVLock]
# The Install VLock rule installs the vlock package to allow users to lock their consoles

[ConsoleRootOnly]
# This class will restrict access to the root log on to console only

[DisableRemoveableStorage]
# DisableRemovablestorage. This rule is optional, and disables USB storage devices from accessing, or being able to be accessed from the system.

[NoCoreDumps]
# This rule disables the ability of the system to produce core dump images

[ConfigureSudo]
# Ensure that the group entered in the text field exists, and that the usernames of all administrators who should be allowed to execute commands as root are members of that group.  This rule will not be applicable to Solaris.  ***Please be aware that the default group for this rule if nothing is entered, is wheel.  If you would like to change the group, enter the desired group in the text field and hit save before running

[BlockSystemAccounts]
# The BlockSystemAccounts rule will search through /etc/passwd to determine if there are any system accounts which currently allow login. If any are found which do allow login, the fix method will append :/dev/null to the end of the entry in /etc/passwd preventing future login from them. One exception is the 'root' account which will not be blocked due access to it being required by administrators in certain situations and local user accounts will not be blocked.

[SetupLogwatch]
# Logwatch is used for reporting on unusual items in syslog. Logwatch is valuable because it provides a parser for the syslog entry format and a number of signatures for types of lines which are considered to be mundane or noteworthy. it is recommended that all Linux sites which do not have time to deploy a third-party log monitoring application run Logwatch in its default configuration. This provides some useful information about system activity in exchange for very little administrator effort.

[SecureNFS]
# Configures and secures NFS

[SetFSMountOptions]
# SetFSMountOptions sets the file system mount options for non-Root local partitions, file systems mounted on removable media, removable storage partitions, and temporary storage partitions such as /tmp and /dev/shm in order to help protect against malicious code being run on the system.

[CheckPartitioning]
# The check for partitioning is an audit only rule that will
# not change system settings. Best *NIX partitioning practices recommend that the
# following areas of the filesystem, if present, be placed on their own
# partitions: /home, /tmp, ,/var, /var/tmp, /var/log, /var/log/audit.

[SecureATCRON]
# The AT and CRON job schedulers are used to schedule jobs for running at a later
# date/time. These daemons should be configured defensively. The SecureATCRON
# class restricts permissions on the files and directories associated with these
# daemons to authorized users only and enables and configures logging for
# these daemons

[NoLegacyPlusAccts]
# The NoLegacyPlusAccts rule ensures that no '+' entries exist in the /etc/shadow, /etc/passwd, or the /etc/group files.  The '+' symbol was used by systems to include data from NIS maps into existing files. A certain configuration error in which NIS inclusion line appears in /etc/passwd but NIS is not running could lead to anyone being able to access the system with the username '+' and no password.

[SymlinkDangerFiles]
# The SymlinkDangerousFiles class checks for the presence of certain files - namely /root/.rhosts, /root/.shosts, and /etc/hosts.equiv, and symlinks them to /dev/null in order to prevent a potentially exploitable weak form of access control. Note that no undo operation is permitted for this rule due to security reasons.

[SetDefaultUserUmask]
# The SetDefaultUserUmask class sets the default user umask to 027. Also accepts user input of alternate 077 umask. Mac OS X will have the umask set to 022 because it breaks with stricter settings.

[SecureFTP]
# Enable logging for all attempted access and ftp commands, restrict the set of users allowed to access ftp and set the default umask for ftp users.
# (Only use this if you set AllowLocalFTP to True) Enter single-space-delimited list of user account names to allow access to FTP.
AllowUsersList = 
UCAllowUsersList = 

[ConfigureSystemAuthentication]
# This rule configures the pam stack for password requirements and password failed login attempts.  It also ensures the system uses SHA512 encryption.  There are three configuration items.  Two of these configuration items are disabled by default and both CI's involve configuring PAM.  Please be advised, due to the complexity and sensitivity of PAM, if you enable these two CI's, portions of the pam files that these two CI's configure will be completely overwritten, therefore if you have configured PAM with other modules, you may want to avoid enabling these two items and configure them by hand.  Also, if on a yum based package manager system such as redhat, fedora, or centos, both pam files have to recieve the same contents.  Due to this, no undo events will be recorded for the first two configuration items.  However backups will be made in the /etc/pam.d directory to restore them back to the way before the rule was run.  Run these rules at your own risk. If your system uses portage for a package manager i.e. gentoo, you will need to do fix manually for all files except for the login.defs file

[DisableBluetooth]
# Disable all bluetooth services, Blacklist all bluetooth drivers, Remove all bluetooth packages, Check to see if all of the above operations have been done or not - report() Currently there is no undo for the disabling of bluetooth services.  Will be implemented very soon

[SecureWinFileSharing]
# This class will secure samba file sharing

[PreventXListen]
# The X graphics display server is network aware. Due to weaknesses in the X server the service should not be exposed to the external network

[ExecShield]
# The ExecShield rule will audit, and if needed correct the settings
# of the kernel functions that provide protection against memory corruption
# attacks such as buffer overflows. These features include ExecShield which
# prevents execution of memory locations that should only hold data and
# va_randomize which randomizes the locations of various memory regions.

[MinimizeServices]
# The MinimizeServices rule will minimize the services that the
# system is running. Each running service is a potential avenue for exploitation
# by an attacker or malicious software. Running only a minimum of services reduces
# vulnerability and helps preserve system resources. Most workstations will leave
# this rule enabled but some server administrators may want to disable this rule.
# 
# This list contains services that are permitted to run on this
# platform. If you need to run a service not currently in this list add the
# service to the list and STONIX will ensure that it is set to run. List elements
# should be space separated.

[DisableWeakAuthentication]
# The Berkley r-commands are legacy services which allow cleartext remote acces and have an insecure trust model.  r-commands suffer from the same hijacking and eavesdropping problems as telnet.  This rules ensures that no r-services are implemented or installed

[PasswordExpiration]
# This rule configures the password configuration for each entry in the shadow file and any other files that pertain to pw expiration, length, warning time, etc.  ***For solaris, please be aware, that there is no undo for the content change of the shadow file but there will be a permissions change undo if the permissions were originally incorrect

[ConfigureDotFiles]
# A user who can modify another user's configuration files can likely execute 
# commands with the other user's privileges, including stealing data, destroying
# files, or launching further attacks on the system. This rule ensures that no
# dot files within users' home directories possess the world/other - writable
# permission.

[DisableIPV6]
# Disables IPV6 functionality.  For solaris systems only the report will be run

[SSHTimeout]
# SSH allows administrators to set an idle timeout interval. After this interval has passed, the idle user will be automatically logged out. 

[SecureIPV6]
# Configures IPV6 functionality 

[SecureMTA]
# Mail servers are used to send and receive mail
# over a network on behalf of site users. Mail is a very common service, and
# MTAs are frequent targets of network attack. Ensure that machines are not
# running MTAs unnecessarily, and configure needed MTAs as defensively as
# possible. Please be advised, in one section of this rule,
# the /etc/mail/sendmail.cf is modified two different times.  Because of this
# the undo event that handles this file if a change is made will only revert one
#  change, the change that is not reverted is the insertion or modification of
# the line that begins with DS.  If you can't remember the original format of
# that line, take a look in the /usr/share/stonix folder for the original file
# before clicking undo
# To prevent the configuration of the mail transfer
# agent, set the value of SECUREMTA to False.
SECUREMTA = True
UCSECUREMTA = 

[ReduceSudoTimeout]
# ReduceSudoTimeout ensures that the sudoers file has a timeout value of 0 so that a password is required for every sudo call.  This is mandatory for Mac users but optional for all other platforms. ***Please note, for all systems besides Mac OS X, this rule is disabled by default.  To enable, click the enable box then click save before running fix****

[SecureSSH]
# The SecureSSH class makes a number of configuration changes to SSH in order to ensure secure use of the functionality.

[InstallBanners]
# Install and configure DOE warning banners, to be displayed at when accessing this system.

[SecureApacheWebserver]
# The Secure Apache Webserver rule will apply secure configurations to the
# Apache webserver configuration file httpd.conf and included files in conf.d or
# other configuration directories. It also applies secure configurations to the
# PHP interpreter's php.ini file if present. There are a series of config options
# for this rule. In general the Apache webserver should not be running on desktop
# systems and should be disabled by the Minimize Services rule. On servers and in
# the case where a developer needs a local instance of the web server running it
# should be properly configured. Server admins running webservers will want to
# review the actions taken by this rule to ensure that it will not affect their
# deployed applications.

[SecureMDNS]
# The Avahi daemon implements the DNS Service Discovery and Multicast DNS protocols, which provide service and host discovery on a network. It allows a system to automatically identify resources on the network, such as printers or web servers. This capability is also known as mDNSresponder and is a major part of Zeroconf networking. By default, it is enabled. This rule makes a number of configuration changes to the avahi service in order to secure it.

[ReqAuthSingleUserMode]
# The ReqAuthSingleUserMode class checks if the system currently requires authentication for single-user mode or not, and if it does not then it makes the necessary config file changes to require authentication for single-user mode.
