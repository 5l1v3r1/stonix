Packaging Information for STONIX
================================

We recommend creating two packages for STONIX: stonix and stonix-server.

There are a small number of files that are only needed by the stonix report 
server, are not needed by the client and could lead to an organizational 
security breach if credentials are left in the stonixImporter.py 
inappropriately.

Included
--------

Included in the source is an RPM spec file and a .deb build script for creating 
packages in those formats. For packagers using other formats please reference 
the spec file for installation locations and permissions.

Pre-packaging Activities
------------------------

Before packaging STONIX it is recommended that the localize.py values be set 
appropriately. This step can be omitted if the localize.py file will be managed 
another way (e.g. puppet or cfengine). It is important that the localize.py be 
set correctly for your organization before stonix is run in fix mode for the 
first time.
