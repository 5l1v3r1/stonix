-----------------------

As STONIX is an uncompiled Python program installation is very straightforward.
To install STONIX manually simply follow these steps:
 1. Copy stonix.py to the appropriate 'bin' folder (/bin, /usr/bin, 
  /usr/local/bin).
 2. Copy stonix_resources to the same folder that you copied stonix.py to.
 3. Recommended not required: symlink stonix to stonix.py.
 4. Touch the /etc/stonix.conf file (touch /etc/stonix.conf).
 5. Install the stonix man page to the appropriate directory.
 6. Edit the <path>/stonix_resources/localize.py file to contain appropriate 
  values.

End System Prerequisites
------------------------

STONIX requires a 2.x version of Python >= 2.5.

For use of the GUI STONIX requires PyQt 4.0 and the appropriate QT libraries.


Usage
------

You should now be able to run stonix from the command line:
# stonix --help

STONIX Report Server Installation
---------------------------------

STONIX has the ability to upload reports to an optional report server. These 
reports may be desired by an organizational continous security monitoring 
effort to track the configuration health of systems over time.

Report Server Requirements
---------------------------

The report server requires PHP, a running web server and MySQL or MariaDB.

Installation
------------

1. mkdir -p /var/www/html/stonix/results.
2. Place the results.php file into the the /var/www/html/stonix directory.
3. Ensure that the webserver has write but not read access to 
  /var/www/html/stonix/results.
4. Install the stonixImporter.py into a bin directory.
5. Install MySQL.
6. Log onto MySQL and run the stonixdb.sql file to create the stonix database.
7. Create a database user to process the reports. User will require Query, 
  Insert, Update on the stonix database.
8. Update the connection credentials in the stonixImporter.py.
9. Ensure that the REPORTSERVER parameter in the localize.py file of the 
  clients whose reports you wish to collect is configured to point to your host.
10. Test.

Usage
-----

For production usage it is recommended that the stonixImporter.py be scheduled 
via cron.
